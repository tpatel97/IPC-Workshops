1. What you have learned in completeing this workshop?
Answer: I learned the basics of the C programming in this workshop. I learned about
        the uses of different commands and also about the mistakes one should not make
        while programming. I learned how to add space between two words using tab command
        and also how to place a specific sentence into double quote. I also learned the 
        importance of "printf" command and also about the use of the "main(void)" command.
 
2. Briefly describe what SSH is and how you used it in this workshop?
Answer: I used the Mobaxterm SSH for this workshop. It was pretty easy to use
        and also provided great response in return. I created my project in the
        Visual Studio 2019 edition and used Mobaxterm(SSH) to submit it to my proffesor.
        
3. Briefly describe what SFTP is and how you used it in this workshop?
Answer: I used WinSCP as the SFTP software to submit my work into my matrix account.
        It is really smooth to use and also shows errors if there is one before copying
        the work into my student matrix account.
